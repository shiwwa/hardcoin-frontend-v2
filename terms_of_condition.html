                        enforcement of such provision. No waiver of any provision in these Terms, however, will
                        be deemed a waiver of a subsequent breach of such provision or a waiver of a similar
                        provision. In addition, a waiver of any breach or a failure to enforce any term or condition
                        of these Terms will not in any way affect, limit, or waive a Party’s rights hereunder at any

                        force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the Parties
                        hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative
                        means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by
                        such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be
                        the intention of the Parties that they would have executed the remaining terms,
                        provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be
